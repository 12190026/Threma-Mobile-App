        The origins of the Dudjom New Treasure Lineage can be traced back to
        Dharmakaya Samantabhadra Buddha. Samantabhadra Buddha transmitted it to
        Vajrasattva who then transmitted to Garab Dorje, then to Manjusrimitra,
        Sri Singha and Padmasambhava. Padmasambhava then transmitted the
        teachings to His consort Yeshe Tsogyal who transmitted to Dudjom Lingpa
        (The 1st Dudjom). Jigdral Yeshe Dorje (The 2nd Dudjom) then received the
        transmission from Dudjom Lingpa’s heart son Jigme Nedun Wangpo. The 2nd
        Dudjom Rinpoche transmitted the terma of Dudjom Lingpa together with
        that of his own discovery to Dungse Garab Dorje Rinpoche. Thus Dungse
        Garab Dorje Rinpoche presently holds the blood lineage as well as the
        Dharma lineage of the Dudjom Rinpoche.{"\n"}

        The Dudjom New Treasure is one of many termas transmitted by Guru
        Padmasambhava during the ninth century and to be propagated at this time
        of degeneration. This is the most profound and appropriate teaching for
        this period of time to purify the negative emotions of sentient and to
        obtain liberation. Amongst the termas of Guru Padmasambhava, the termas
        obtained by Dudjom Lingpa and the 2nd Dudjom Rinpoche are the latest and
        nearest to this period of time. Thus is called the Dudjom New Treasure.

        The special and profound qualities of the Dudjom New Treasure:
        {"\n"} {"\n"}
        1)The Dudjom New Treasure was directly taught by Padmasambhava and Yeshe
        Tsogyal, so the lineage is very short. It is pure and fresh with great
        blessing, which means the lineage warmth has not dissipated.
        {"\n"} {"\n"}
        2)The Dudjom New Treasure teachings are clear and complete in
        themselves. Its practice texts are simple and profound, graduated paths
        are clear and complete. It appears to be simple but once one enters the
        path, other paths become clear and easily realized.
        {"\n"} {"\n"}
        3)The Dudjom New Treasure has complete teachings for accomplishment in
        one life for all sentient beings.
        {"\n"} {"\n"}
        4)The gradual stages of practice are systematic and most important of
        all it is complete with all the profound secret pith instructions.
        {"\n"} {"\n"}
        5)The Dudjom New Treasure: “Dud” means the five poisons, conflicting
        emotions, maras; “jom” means cut-off, eliminate, destroy. The Dudjom
        terma for this period of time is a system of teachings for followers of
        the lineage to cut samsara from its root, eliminate conflicting emotions
        and obtain liberation in this very life. It is widely acclaimed to be a
        crown jewel for quick liberation among the Vajrayana in modern time.

        The Dudjom New Treasure Lineage is clear and complete in itself in all
        aspects.
        {"\n"} {"\n"}
        The Dudjom New Treasure Lineage has complete and clear records of each
        lineage holders. The First Dudjom Rinpoche Dudjom Lingpa was a great
        terton. At the age of 25, Padmasambhava, Yeshe Tsogyal and several
        Dakinis instructed him to reveal treasure teachings. This terma revealed
        by Dudjom Lingpa is known as The Dudjom New Treasure and can be
        classified 4 classes of teachings. The first three are “mind treasure”
        and the fourth is “ground treasure”, all together 20 volumes.
        {"\n"} {"\n"}
        1)“Essence of Wisdom of the Pure State”: practice of dakini Krodikali is
        the main practice. The second Dudjom Rinpoche prophesied that in the
        future, The Dudjom New Treasure lineage shall be widely propagated based
        on the teachings of the Dakini Krodikali.

        transmitted directly to Dudjom Lingpa by Yeshe Tsogyal. Great terton
        Jigdral Yeshe Dorje, the second Dudjom Rinpoche, was able to have direct
        communication with Guru Padmasambhava, Yeshe Tsogyal and other great
        masters. He knew many spots where treasure teachings were hidden and
        would reveal them at the appropriate time. Within the Dudjom New
        Treasure, he also had four classes of terma, all of which are “mind
        treasure”. This has 25 volumes. {"\n"} {"\n"}1)“Heart Essence of
